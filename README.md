I'm a software tester with experience in performing Manual testing, API testing, and Automation Testing of Software, Embedded Systems, and IOT applications to ensure the highest quality and usability of the software.

- Writing test scenarios and detailed test cases
- Performing functional, regression, and usability testing
- Identifying and documenting defects

Additionally, my programming skills in Java, Python, and C, along with my knowledge of databases, allow me to approach testing with a structured and analytical mindset.
